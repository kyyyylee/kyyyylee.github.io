          When gazing up at the Moon in the night sky, envision a future where
          humans can live and work on the lunar surface. Part of that work
          includes valuable research, as the Moon offers two environments
          important for science and to which we do not currently have access
          down on the ground: The Moon's gravity is only about one-sixth of
          Earth's, and it has a very thin atmosphere which is exposed to more
          intense radiation than exists on Earth. Additionally, establishing a
          sustainable presence on the Lunar surface is an essential step towards
          preparing for missions to Mars.
        </p>

          However, before that, to go farther and stay longer in space,
          including to Mars, we must investigate how biological and physical
          phenomena behave in the unique environment of the Moon.
        </p>

          To pave the way for human exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond,
          NASA's Artemis missions are set up as a series of increasingly complex
          missions. The first, Artemis I will be an uncrewed test flight of the
          Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion spacecraft around the Moon.
          The primary goals for this test flight are to demonstrate Orion's
          systems and thus ensure a safe journey to the Moon and back for the
          first crewed flight on Artemis II.

          BioExpt-01 includes four investigations that will evaluate effects of
          the deep space environment on the nutritional value of plant seeds,
          DNA repair within fungi, adaptation of yeast, and algal gene
          expression. By sending these investigations through two giant donuts
          of radiation around Earth called the Van Allen Belts — to areas beyond
          low-Earth orbit — researchers will gain understanding of the elevated
          levels and impacts of ionizing radiation on biological life forms like
          never before. This knowledge will help us to understand how biological
          life forms can better thrive in deep space and support future manned
          missions to the Moon and Mars.
